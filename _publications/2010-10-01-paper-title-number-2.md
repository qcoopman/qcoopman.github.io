The thermodynamic phase transition of clouds is still not well understood, therefore, the partitioning of ice and liquid in mixed phase clouds is often misrepresented in numerical models. We use 12 years of cloud observations from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager over the Southern Ocean to detect clouds which contain both liquid and ice pixels at their tops and we retrieve microphysical and radiative properties in each cloud object. The results show that large cloud droplet effective radius coincides with high ice fraction and high ice optical thickness for cloud top temperatures higher than âˆ’8 degree Celsius. We also found that the density of ice pixel clusters increases with the cloud ice fraction, for ice fraction lower than 0.5, suggesting a multiplication of ice pockets in line with previous studies, particularly efficient for clouds with high perimeter fractal dimension.
