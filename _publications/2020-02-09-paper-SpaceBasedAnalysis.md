Clouds are liquid at temperature greater than 0 degree Celsius and ice at temperature below −38 degree Celsius. Between these two thresholds, the temperature of the cloud thermodynamic phase transition from liquid to ice is difficult to predict and the theory and numerical models do not agree: Microphysical, dynamical, and meteorological parameters influence the glaciation temperature. We temporally track optical and microphysical properties of 796 clouds over Europe from 2004 to 2015 with the space-based instrument Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager on board the geostationary METEOSAT second generation satellites. We define the glaciation temperature as the mean between the cloud top temperature of those consecutive images for which a thermodynamic phase change in at least one pixel is observed for a given cloud object. We find that, on average, isolated convective clouds over Europe freeze at −21.6 degree Celsius. Furthermore, we analyze the temporal evolution of a set of cloud properties and we retrieve glaciation temperatures binned by meteorological and microphysical regimes: For example, the glaciation temperature increases up to 11 degree Celsius when cloud droplets are large, in line with previous studies. Moreover, the correlations between the parameters characterizing the glaciation temperature are compared and analyzed and a statistical study based on principal component analysis shows that after the cloud top height, the cloud droplet size is the most important parameter to determine the glaciation temperature.
