Phase transitions leading to cloud glaciation occur at temperatures that vary between -38 degree Celsius and 0 degree Celsius depending on aerosol types and concentrations, the meteorology, and cloud microphysical and macrophysical parameters, although the relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we statistically retrieve a cloud glaciation temperature from two passive space-based instruments that are part of the NASA/CNES A-Train, the POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We compare the glaciation temperature for varying bins of cloud droplet effective radius, latitude, and large-scale vertical pressure velocity and specific humidity at 700 hPa. Cloud droplet size has the strongest influence on glaciation temperature: For cloud droplets larger than 21 micrometer, the glaciation temperature is 6 degree Celsius higher than for cloud droplets smaller than 9 micrometer. Stronger updrafts are also associated with lower glaciation temperatures.
