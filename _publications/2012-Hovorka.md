We present atomistic calculations of the magnetic phase transition behavior in an L10 FePt system to study the effect of grain size distribution on the Curie temperature (⁠Tc⁠) dispersion with relevance to heat assisted magnetic recording. Identifying the relation between the size and Tc of a grain by means of finite size scaling analysis of the differentiated magnetization versus T data allows to show that a lognormal size distribution transforms into a lognormal Tc distribution with moments dependent on the critical exponents. We also address the question of the universality class of FePt.
